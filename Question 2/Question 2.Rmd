# Introduction {-}

I will be showing you the max, average and min temerature averages through the past several years, I will then illustrtate how much sun on average London gets looking at the past several year and then looking soely on the year of 2020. 


# Data 

```{r}
library(readr)
london_weather <- read_csv("C:/Users/austi/OneDrive/Desktop/Masters/Data Science/22582053/Question 2/data/london_weather.csv")


```

## creating data frame with max, min and average

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(lubridate)


london_max_mean_min <- london_weather_trends(london_weather)
```


## Plotting the max, min and average

```{r}
temp_trend_plot(london_max_mean_min)
```

As can be seen in the above figure the min temerature gets to around minus 10 degrees which i know you as a fair weather girl will not enjoy. Furthermore the average temperature is only at a mere 10 degrees. 

## Looking at the amount of sunshine london gets

### Creating a data frame with sunshine

```{r}

    
london_sunshine <- calculate_avg_sunshine(london_weather)

```

### Ploting hours of sunshine per day on average

```{r}
plot_avg_sunshine(london_sunshine)

```

As can be seen from the above figure there are many years that receive less than 5 to 7 hpurs of sunchine a day on average. I know you wont enjoy that. You may be saying that recently it has been getting better, that is why I have made the next plot. 


## Plotting London hours of sunshine per day for 2020

```{r}
london_sunshine_last_year<- london_weather %>% 
    arrange(date) %>% 
    mutate(date = as.Date(as.character(date), format = "%Y%m%d")) %>% 
    filter(date>= lubridate::ymd("20200101")) 

plot_sunshine_per_day(london_sunshine_last_year)


```

From the above figure the red lines show days where there was sunshine for over 7 overs and the blue lines show days throughout the year where there was less than 7 hours of sunshine. As you can see there are way too many days (which can be consecutive) where there is less than 7 hours of sun. 


# Conclusion 

PLease stay, there is not enough sun and the temp is way too cold for you.
